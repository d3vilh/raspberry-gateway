[![latest version](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/d3vilh/raspberry-gateway?color=%2344cc11&label=Latest%20release&style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/d3vilh/raspberry-gateway/releases/tag/latest)
# Requirements
  - [**Raspberry Pi 4**](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/), [**Raspberry Pi CM4**](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/compute-module-4/?variant=raspberry-pi-cm4001000) **and** [**CM4 I/O Board**](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/compute-module-4-io-board/) or [**Raspberry Pi 3**](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/) board, with 1-2Gb RAM.
  - [**Raspberry Pi Imager**](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) to simplify installation of Raspberry Pi OS Lite (x64 or i686 bit).
  - [**Raspios Lite (64bit)**](https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspios_lite_arm64/images/) however is recommended for this setup.
  - **16Gb SD Card**
    > **Note**: You can run it on CM4 board with 8Gb eMMC card. Full installation on top of latest [Raspios lite (64bit)](https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspios_lite_arm64/images/) will use 4,5Gb of your eMMC card. Raspberry Pi **Zero-W** or **W2** boards can also be used, but it's important to note that they lack an internal Ethernet adapter and have limited CPU and RAM resources. This can restrict the number of containers that can be run and the number of clients that can connect to the VPN server.

# Installation
  1. Install [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html):
     ```shell 
     sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip
     pip3 install ansible
     ```
  2. Clone this repository: 
     ```shell
     git clone https://github.com/d3vilh/raspberry-gateway
     ```
  3. Then enter the repository directory: 
     ```shell 
     cd raspberry-gateway
     ```
  4. Install requirements: 
     ```shell
     ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml
     ```
     > **Note**: If you see `ansible-galaxy: command not found`, you have to relogin (or reboot your Pi) and then try again.
  <details>
    <summary>Continue Installation with WebUI</summary>
   
   **This is still under testing!** If you afraid of it - just skip to CLI installation.

  5. Run [Webinstall](https://github.com/d3vilh/raspberry-gtw-webconfig) binary:
     ```shell
     secret@rpgw:~/raspberry-gateway $ ./webinstall
     2023/07/07 18:01:03 Welcome! The web interface will guide you on installation process.
     Installation logs: webinstall.log
     2023/07/07 18:01:03 Starting web server on http://10.10.10.18:8088
     ```
  6. Copy server address (`http://10.10.10.18:8088` as above example) from the console and paste into your browser, then press Enter. Raspberry-Gateway webinstall window will appear:
     ![Raspberry Monitoring Dashboard in Grafana picture 1](/images/Webinstall-01.png)
  7. Choose all the components you would like to install and change all the passwords (keep them in mind). 
     > **Note**: You can leave all the passwords as default, but it's not recommended.
  8. Press "Save" button. When your configuration is ready:
     ![Raspberry Monitoring Dashboard in Grafana picture 1](/images/Webinstall-02.png)
  9. Then press "Install" button. It will initiate installation in background:
     ![Raspberry Monitoring Dashboard in Grafana picture 1](/images/Webinstall-03.png)
  10. The installation process will take some time.
      Once that's done, it'll be like you have a new **Raspberry Gateway** up and running.

      You can scroll down for `Quick Links` or close browser window and anjoy your new Raspberry Gateway.

    <summary>Install everything with CLI</summary>
   
   **Safiest option**. Tested may times and works like a charm.

  5. Make copies of the configuration files and modify them for your enviroment:
      ```shell
      yes | cp -p example.inventory.yml inventory.yml 
      yes | cp -p example.config.yml config.yml
      ```
  6. Modify `inventory.yml` by replace of IP address with your Pi's IP, or comment that line and uncomment the `connection=local` line if you're running it on the Pi you're setting up. **Double check** that the `ansible_user` is correct for your setup.
  7. Modify `config.yml` to **enabe or disable desired containers** to be installed on your Pi:
     **To enable** Prtainer - change `enable_portainer: false` option to `enable_portainer: true` and vs to disable.
      > **Note**: To make all necesary changes: `nano config.yml`, save the file - `Ctrl+O` and `Ctrl+X` to exit.

   * **UI access port** no UI available, running in Back-End
   * **Default password** password is not required
   * **External ports** used by container, by default: `random free port`
   * **Configuration files** are available after the installation and located in `~/openvpn-client/*` directory. 
   * **Configuration Options** necessary for the installation (defined in `config.yml` file)`):
     * `ovpn_client_cert: "example-client.opvn"` - file with your OpenVPN connection profile (`*.ovpn`). You have to put it into `~/raspberry-gateway/openvpn-client/` directory before installation and update its name in `ovpn_client_cert`. Use the [**example-client.ovpn**](https://github.com/d3vilh/raspberry-gateway/blob/master/openvpn-client/example-client.ovpn#L1) as a refference of all necessary options and file format. After the installation your `*.ovpn` file will be moved to `~/openvpn-client/*.ovpn` and used by container. If for some reason you need to change it, you have to put new file with the same name in `~/openvpn-client/` directory and restart openvpn-client container (`docker openvpn-client restart`).
     * `ovpn_client_allowed_subnet: "192.168.88.0/24" ` - Your local newtwork (WiFi or whatever), from which you want to access qBitTorrent WEB-UI when VPN Client connection is active.
   * **Advanced Configuration** can be predefined in [`advanced.config.yml`](https://github.com/d3vilh/raspberry-gateway/blob/master/advanced.config.yml#L56) before the installation:
     * `ovpn_client_secret: "filename.txt"` - filename with your OpenVPN connection profile user and password if you have any. You have to put it into `~/raspberry-gaveway/openvpn-client/` directory before installation and update its name in `ovpn_client_secret`. Use the [**example-credentials.txt**](https://github.com/d3vilh/raspberry-gateway/blob/master/openvpn-client/example-credentials.txt#L1) as refference.
     * `ovpn_client_killswitch: true` - If set to `true`, it will block all the traffic when VPN is connected, except the one from the `ovpn_client_allowed_subnet` subnet.

  For more documentation and How-to, please check dedicated [**openvpn-client README.md**](https://github.com/d3vilh/raspberry-gateway/tree/master/openvpn-client) file.

   > **Note**: If you just looking for all purpose OpenVPN client for Raspberry-Pi or x86 PC, please check [**vpntv**](https://github.com/d3vilh/vpntv) project.

  All the Data sources, Dashboards and exporters are automatically provisioned. Below you can find the list of available dashboards and their URLs.

   ### Grafana
   Used to visualize all the data provided by Prometheus.
   * **UI access port** `http://localhost:3030/`, (*change `localhost` to your Raspberry host ip/name*)
   * **Default password** is `admin/admin`, it is [preconfigured in](https://github.com/d3vilh/raspberry-gateway/blob/master/example.config.yml#L87) `config.yml` file and only used the first time Grafana starts up
   * **External ports** used by container: `3030:tcp`
   * **Configuration files** are available after the installation and located in `~/monitoring/grafana/` directory
   * **Advanced Configuration** Before the installation, can be predefined in [`advanced.config.yml`](https://github.com/d3vilh/raspberry-gateway/blob/master/advanced.config.yml#L82).

   #### Here is list of available Grafana dashboards:
   * **Raspberry Pi Monitoring**: Shows CPU, memory, and disk usage, as well as network traffic, temperature and Docker containers utilisation. `http://localhost:3030/d/rvk35ERRz/raspberry-monitoring`
   * **OpenVPN Monitoring**: - OpenVPN activity dashboard. `http://localhost:3030/d/58l7kyvVz/openvpn`
   * **AirGradient Monitoring** - Air quality dashboard. `http://localhost:3030/d/aglivingroom/airquality-airgradient`

   > **Note**: Change `localhost` to your Raspberry ip/hostname.

  If you don't see any data on the dashboard - try to change the time duration to something smaller. If this does not help - check via **Portainer UI** that all the exporters and containers are running:

  <img src="/images/portainer-run.png" alt="Running containers" width="350" border="1" />
