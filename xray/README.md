  # Basic Xray Server Configuration
   > **!Beaware!**: Some protocols described here are [prohibited in PRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadowsocks). Don't use this if you are in PRC. This is for your educational purposes only. 

   #### Xray facts:
   * **UI access port** `http://localhost:54321`, (*change `localhost` to your Raspberry host ip/name*)
   * **Default password** is `admin/admin`, which **must** be changed via web interface on first login (`Pannel Settings` > `User Settings`).
   * **External ports** used by container: `443:tcp`, `80:tcp`, `54321:tcp`(by default), Inbound ports you'll configure.
   * **Configuration files** are available after the installation and located in `~/xray/` directory
   * **Advanced Configuration** No advanced configuration.
   * **It is Important** to change following settings for better security:
     * default password in `Pannel Settings` > `User Settings` > `Password` to something strong and secure.
     * default pannel port in `Pannel Settings` > `Pannel Configurations` > `Pannel Port` from `54321` to some random port (the best in the upper end of the range, up to `65535`)
     * default configuration pannel URL in `Pannel Settings` > `Pannel Configurations` > `Panel URL Root Path` to something random, like `/mysecretpannel/` or `/superxray/`.

## Inbounds configuration
Now when default security configuration is done. It is time to configure Xray to work with your Raspberry. There is few steps below you should follow.

### 1. SHADOWSOCKS Configuration
To create Shadowsocks Inbound you need to:
* Enable Subscriptions:
`Pannel Service` > `Subscriptions` > `Enable Service` > `ON`
`Save` > `Restart Pannel` to apply Subscriptions.
* Add new Inbound:
`Inbounds` > `Add Inbound`:
  * `Remark`: Anything humanreadable to identify this inbound (`ShadowSocks`, for example)
  * `Protocol`: `shadowsocks`
  * `Listen IP`: IP where server will listen for connections. You can leave it empty in this case it will listen on all interfaces.
  * `Listen Port`: Port where server will listen for connections. It is random by default - leave it.
  * `Total Flow GB` and `Expire date` is limit parameters you could sent for this inbound. Leave it empty for unlimited.
  * `Client` >
    * `Email`: Anything humanreadable, to identify this client (`ShadowUser1`, for example)
    * `Password`: Password for desired encryption. It is random by default - leave it.
    * `Subscription`: `User1` Anything humanreadable to identify this Subscription.
    * `Encryption`: for Shadowsocks use any encryption you like which starts with 2022. For example `2022-blake3-aes-256-gcm`
    * `Network`: `tcp,udp` or `tcp` for Shadowsocks
    * `Transmission`: `tcp`
You can use Shadowsocks now, but it is better to continue with VLESS & XTLS-Reality configuration following step below.

### 2. VLESS & XTLS-Reality Configuration
To create VLESS Inbound you need to:
* Enable Subscriptions:
`Pannel Service` > `Subscriptions` > `Enable Service` > `ON`
`Save` > `Restart Pannel` to apply Subscriptions.
* Add new Inbound:
`Inbounds` > `Add Inbound`:
  * `Remark`: Anything humanreadable to identify this inbound (`Reality`, for example)
  * `Protocol`: `vless`
  * `Listen IP`: IP where server will listen for connections. You can leave it empty in this case it will listen on all interfaces.
  * `Listen Port`: `443` Port where server will listen for connections.
  * `Total Flow GB` and `Expire date` is limit parameters you could sent for this inbound. Leave it empty for unlimited.
  * `Client` >
    * `Email`: Anything humanreadable, to identify this client (`RealUser1`, for example)
    * `ID`: Random UUID by default - leave it.
    * `Subscription`: `User1` Keep it same as you set for Shadowsocks.
    * `Accept Proxy Protocol`: `Reality` This is important to enable before setting next options.
    * `Flow`: `xtls-rprx-vision` This option will appear above the `Subscription` option after enabling `Accept Proxy Protocol`.
    * `Domain name`: `yourdomain.com` Your domain name. You can leave it empty if you don't have one, so X-UI will automatically insert your IP.
    * `Xver`: `0` Leave it default. IDK what is it for.
    * `uTLS`: `Firefox` Leave it default, `Firefox` or `Chrome` are desirable and most reliable to clients options.
    * `Dest`, `Server Names`: `microsoft.com:443` and `microsoft.com,www.microsoft.com` This is domains under which you will "disguise yourself". This should be some popular external domain, which is not blocked by your SP, Organisation or Goverment (I hope you know consequences and have strong reason for).
    * `Shorts`: Random by default - leave it.
    * `Private Key` and `Public Key`: Click `Get New Cert` button below.
* Save it, and you are done.

Here how Realty Configuration looks like:

<img src="https://github.com/d3vilh/raspberry-gateway/blob/master/images/XRAY-Realty-Config2.png" alt="Raspberry Realty Configuration 2" width="150" border="0" />

This is what you'll have as a result of our configuration:

## Additional Options.
Under `Pannel Settings` > `Xray Configuration` you can find some additional options. Such as block BitTorrent traffic for your Clients or enable Ads Blocking or Family-Friendly for them. 
You can block connections to specific countries from the list like China, Russia, etc.
In addition you can setup XRAY Telegram Bot which will help you to manage your XRAY Server via Telegram.
